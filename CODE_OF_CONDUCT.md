# Code of Conduct

**SSSSLEEPING** is a large-scale collaborative effort, and working together effectively and communally is an essential aspect to its success. We expect inclusive and courteous behavior from all those involved. Please be patient with others and always offer assistance when possible. Everyone involved is entering from different backgrounds and with different levels of experience.

## A special note about working collaboratively in GoogleDocs
GoogleDocs is a nice collaborative tool, where multiple people can edit the same document in realtime. Please be mindful that your edits and deletes are not saved in an "older version," and so if uncertain, refrain from deleting others' writing by instead adding a comment to highlighted text. Also use the side chat to talk about quickly solvable issues.
