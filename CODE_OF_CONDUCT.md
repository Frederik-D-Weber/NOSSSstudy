# Code of Conduct

**SSSSLEEPING** is a large-scale collaborative effort, and working together effectively and communally is an essential aspect to its success. We expect inclusive and courteous behavior from all those involved. Please be patient with others and always offer assistance when possible. Everyone involved is entering from different backgrounds and with different levels of experience.

### Working collaboratively in Google Docs
Google Docs is a nice collaborative tool, where multiple people can edit the same document in realtime (up to 100 persons). 
- Please be mindful that your edits and deletes are not saved in an "older version," and so if uncertain, refrain from deleting others' writing without a very good reason. Instead add a comment or highlight the text. You can also suggest edits, that can be resolved by others.
 - Please use your google account and stay logged in to be identified, so others can see who is working on what.
 - Respect if others are working currently on a section of text, and if possible let them finish before interfering.
 - Please work only on this one document, always! Also do not fork the document and then copy and paste section from that section to this document. 
 - Do not be afraid to make mistakes or typos, it is ok to not be perfect, you will see nobody is perfact.
 - If issues are resolved the comments should be deleted as soon as possible.
 - Take time to communicate and with others, that means read AND listen what others have to say or ask about the text. 
 - Make use of the side chat to talk about quickly solvable issues. NOTE, the side chat is not tracked and will be deleted.
 - Be nice, be helpful, and help others out!
