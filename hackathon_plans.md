### Assignment groups

1. Complete OSF preregistration form.
    a. All OSF preregistration forms follow the same outline. Build this outline in a separate text editor and then we can enter in the results as a group. Browse examples on [OSF registries](https://osf.io/registries) or a template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DaNmJEtBy04bq1l5OxS4JAscdZEkUGATURWwnBKLYxk/edit?pli=1) for building the form.
