### Assignment groups

1. **Complete OSF preregistration form.**
    1. All OSF preregistration forms follow the same outline. Build this outline in a separate text editor and then we can enter in the results as a group. Browse examples on [OSF registries](https://osf.io/registries) or a template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DaNmJEtBy04bq1l5OxS4JAscdZEkUGATURWwnBKLYxk/edit?pli=1) for building the form.

2. **Write Introduction section.**
    1. Brief description of the CN Sleep Summer Camp and the goal of this paper.
    2. **_Brief_** review of sleep and memory (e.g., does memory improve with sleep? what stages of sleep impact what kind of memories?)

    4. What are the predictions we are making?

3. **Write Methods section.**

4. **Write (empty) Results section.**

5. **Write behavioral analysis code.**
    
    > For the analysis of the data we will use free and open-source software where possible (e.g. R, python, FieldTrip, SleepTrip/SpiSOP, JASP). We have outlines of the behavioral analysis written in [R Markdown]() to help get started.

    1. Sample participant data available [here]().
    2. This includes code for statistical analysis and visualizations.

6. **Write sleep data analysis code.**

    > Sleep data will be collected using the [Hypnodyne ZMax](http://hypnodynecorp.com/).

    1. Sample participant data available [here]().
    2. This includes code for statistical analysis and visualizations.
    3. Scoring and cleaning the sleep and wake data
