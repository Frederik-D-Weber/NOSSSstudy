We all together will collect the data and collaboratively create a paper as part of the Radboud University Neuroscience of Sleep Summer School. Forty attendees from the Summer School will be participants in a sleep and memory study by having their memory, attention and sleep being tracked across 3 lectures and 3 nights. The same participants as well as other attendees will take part in all the research steps, from preregistration to analysis code to manuscript writeup. There are no restrictions, anyone attending the Summer School is able to partake.

A large part of the work will occur during the two Summer School hands-on sessions (17:30-22:00 on Thursday and 16:00-18:00 on Friday). There, everyone will help to write a preregistration form on OSF, an early version of the manuscript, and the core of the analysis code. We will work on these in groups, and people are free to choose what they work on. Collaborative work will continue after the Summer Camp through the OSF and GitHub repositories and GoogleDocs.

Aside from investigating questions about sleep and memory, a large purpose of this paper is to work with open science tools and promote transparency in science. Accordingly, we have an OSF [page](https://osf.io/52gy7/) where all the data and code for the experiment are available, and we will preregister the study before running analyses.

All involved should be aware of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Overview of collected data
- Sleep EEG/ZMax, 3x 6-9 h nights
- Daytime EEG/ZMax, 4x 1 h lectures
- Morning questionnaires about night's sleep (e.g., mood, dreaming), 3x
- Afternoon questionnaires about lecture content (e.g., prior knowledge on lecture content), 3x
- Demographics form, 1x

### Example hypotheses
- Daytime drowsiness and nighttime sleep interact in affecting learning, such that daytime drowsiness and following nighttime sleep affect the consolidation of the targeted lecture content.
- Overall worse sleep (i.e. more fragmentation) decreases overall learning (i.e. worse quiz performance).
- More sleep spindles preceding/following the night of the lecture will increase the memory performance of the target lecture content.
- Sleep quality will increase/decrease over the summer school.
- Daytime drowsiness will increase over the three days and will lead to worse performance.
