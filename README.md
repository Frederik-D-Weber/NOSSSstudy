We all together will collect the data and collaboratively create a paper as part of the Radboud University Neuroscience of Sleep Summer School. Forty attendees from the Summer School will be participants in a sleep and memory study by having their memory, attention and sleep being tracked across 3 lectures and 3 nights. The same participants as well as other attendees will take part in all the research steps, from preregistration to analysis code to manuscript writeup. There are no restrictions, anyone attending the Summer School is able to partake.
<br>
A large part of the work will occur during the two Summer School hands-on sessions (17:30-22:00 on Thursday and 16:00-18:00 on Friday). There, everyone will help to write a preregistration form on OSF, an early version of the manuscript, and the core of the analysis code. We will work on these in groups, and people are free to choose what they work on.
<br>
Aside from investigating questions about sleep and memory, a large purpose of this paper is to work with open science tools and promote transparency in science. Accordingly, we have an OSF [page]() where all the data and code for the experiment are available, and we will preregister the study before running analyses.
