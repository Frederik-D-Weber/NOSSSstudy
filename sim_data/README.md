This folder contains simulated behavioural data for three seperate questionnaires:
- a morning questionnaire (e.g. sleep quality, hours slept...)
- a lecture questionnaire (prior knowledge on lecture topic)
- a memory questionnaire (scores for each memory question, either correct, partially correct or incorrect)

The data was simulated using the R-script: SSSSLEEPING_simulated_beh_data.Rmd
